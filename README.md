###### Analysis :
    
###### OBSERVED TREND 1:
Major share of the fare revenue is from the urban areas(cities) however, it is derived from many short rides (63% of revenue from 68% of rides and 78% of the drivers). This also means that business costs are higher (as more drivers and more cabs are needed to generate same amount of revenue as compared to in rural & suburban cities. Bigger fleet also means more maintenance and higher insurance costs. Though this market is the bread winner, more growth may not be there. This needs to be confirmed by finding out the market share as compared to competitors. 
    
###### OBSERVED TREND 2:
Though rural cities account for very small percentage of revenue, the profit margins are significantly higher, as only 
3% of the drivers, with only 5% of the rides (i.e. with small fleet of vehicles), are generating over 6.5% revenue!! This is because each ride derives much higher fare revenue on average. (Insurance costs are low too in rural areas). As profit margins are high and market penetration seems to be low (which needs to be confirmed with more market research), management should think of tapping the business growth opportunity by increasing market share in rural areas.
                                                                                                        
###### OBSERVED TREND 3:                   
We think that suburban cities also present significant growth opportunities, as they account for only 9% of the drivers and 26% of the rides are generating 30% of the revenue!! 

###### RECOMMENDATION :
We recommend tracking other two data points, revenue per mile and profit per mile in each of the 3 types of
cities. This data will probe more into the operational metrics and provide clarity into how the fleets can be made 
more efficient.
